Slavic Themed Horror Game 



This is an eerie slavic horror school project I did in a week while trying to fit in all the pre-planned monsters, all of them with different behaviours.

Vodinoy is an eerie Slavic horror school project that I developed in just 5 days. It showcases various mechanics and features a range of monsters, each with unique behaviors. This downloadable game for Windows and Linux immerses you in a cursed swamp, where you must seek salvation amidst a myriad of terrifying creatures.

## Gameplay Overview

In Vodinoy, you venture into the cursed lands, armed with only a lamp that can store light. The light is your ally, protecting you from the malevolent entities that dwell in the depths of the swamp. Your objective is to find a way out of this perilous place before these creatures consume you.

Be cautious as you explore the swamp and uncover its secrets. Here are the horrors you might encounter:

- **Leshy**: A persistent creature that constantly follows you. If you stand still, Leshy will catch up to you.

- **Soul-sucking tentacles**: Found at the bottom of the swamp, these tentacles will attack when you approach. However, they fear the light, so carrying a light source will make them retreat.

- **Vodinoys**: They are activated when you disturb the moving spirit trees. As you progress, their numbers increase. They get scared if you look at them but if you don't they wont hesitate to consume you from behind.

- **Hell singer**: By disturbing the moving spirit trees,  you will summon the Hell singer. This entity will capture you and transport you to an unknown dimension.

## Updates and Features

Here are some tips to aid you in your journey:
